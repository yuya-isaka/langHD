# langHD: Language Recognition Algorithms Using Hyper-dimensional Computing

## Prerequisites
- Having [Go](https://go.dev/) installed.

## How to run
- Open the folder and type ```go run main.go``` in the terminal.

## Features
- The algorithm determines whether a given query string is English or French.
- Hyper-vectors are generated by providing English and French documents as pre-supervised data. The generated hyper-vectors are classified by calculating the cosine similarity of the hyper-vectors of the query string.
